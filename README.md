**HappyTime** is a time tracker, helping you to store the best moments of your days. With a Windows tracker, it records the programs you use and presents it on a time table. 

**An accomplishment worth remembering?** Just use an easy-to-reach button and write an inspiring note, with a screenshot automatically attached.
